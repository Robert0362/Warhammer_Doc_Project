        <p class="fs-6 text m-3">
              I started Playing Warhammer Fantasy in 2002. I bought the big red box of 6th edition, Empire and the Orcs. I painted up an Empire 
           Army and I thought they were good but then I saw they were not. I stuck with the playing but they did not look good at all. So I slowly
           moved to High Elves and then dove headlong into the Lizardmen and I love my Lizardmen and still do They look Great and they played 
           tough as nails. I made it to the top 5 in the 2005 Atlanta Grand Tournament, the damned Sylvannian List form Storm of Chaos was the last 
           2 armies I faced and that list was broken. I added Ogres and I also had a Chaos list.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-6 text m-3">
              I could not stay away from 40K I started 40K in 3rd edition. This time my first army was the Imperial Guard, I mixed old metal 
            Cadians with Steel Legion Models. Who can play 40K and not have a Space Marine Army. I also added Sisters of Battle. I replaced my metal 
            guard with what was the newer plastic Cadians. Still have my Cadians and my Sisters, the Marines were not up to my standard so I sold them
            off and I am starting over now with them. I do have my eyes on a Chaos Daemon army. I got all the right starts, Greater Deamon of
            Slaanesh, Greater Deamon of Nurgle, Deamon Princes of Khorne and Nurgle, and Tzeencth deamons.           
        </p> 
        <p class="fs-6 text m-3">
            I have organized many tournaments. I ran a Charity Tournament in the Atlanta Area for 2 years. I love organizing the tounament scene 
            but you always have that one player at the end of the event that makes you regret it.
